Prerequisite: have NodeJS installed with `npm` enabled.

Steps to run project:

2. In your terminal, navigate to the `/alex_ortega` folder that is in the cloned repository.
3. Inside the `alex_ortega` folder, run `npm install` to compile the source code for the project.
4. Once the project compiles, in the same folder run `npm run serve` to run the project locally. 
5. If the command from step 4 is successful, two links will be seen. Local and Network IPs will be provided.
