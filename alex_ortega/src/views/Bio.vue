        Hello again, my full name is Alejandro David Ortega and I was born in El
        Paso, Texas. El Paso is a border city and the cultural convergence in
        this city is what kept me intrigued to keep learning. I currently live
        in El Paso and I am enrolled at the University of Texas at El Paso. As a
        kid I was always interested to know how certain things worked and why
        they worked the way they did. I guess I never grew out of that because I
        always want to learn the function of something new.

        When I was in High School I was able to be part of the IT program my
        school offered. I had a great teacher and this is where it all started.
        Through the program I was able to get my A+ and Network+ certifications.
        As a senior in High School I had earned the privilege to be a student IT
        technician and I would assist teachers, counselors, all staff. I would
        also would help maintain the computer labs in the school. It was a fun
        and it was my best High School experience.

        Starting my IT career after graduating from High School helped me
        develop better intrapersonal skills. Those learned skills allowed me to
        collaborate better with others and express ideas. I also learned so much
        as a professional in IT. I always wanted to apply my newly learned
        skills in relevant situations. My manager, the IT manager, helped me
        greatly as he would assign me to various projects and positions.
      </p>

        When I am not busy working with a computer, I can be found working out,
        jogging (a new hobby), playing chess or simply spending time with
        friends and family. I used to play football so I always try find a way
        to stay active. I also like to read books when I am not in school.
      </p>

        I've had great mentors throughout my life and that has shaped the way I
        carry myself and think. One common idea they have all shared with me is
        that I can do anything I set my mind to. I also aspire to positively
        impact others so they can reach their goals. I am just full of gratitude
        and I am ready to keep learning. I am a student for life!
